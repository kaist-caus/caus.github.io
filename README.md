## How to Update Website Content

You don't need to be a programmer to make changes! All updates can be done directly from the GitHub website. The entire website is contained in a single file: `index.html`.

### The Easiest Way to Edit: Step-by-Step

Let's say you want to change the description of a research area.

1.  **Find the file:** In this repository, click on the `index.html` file.
2.  **Open the editor:** On the top-right of the file view, click the small **pencil icon** (âœŽ). This will open a simple web-based text editor.
3.  **Find the text you want to change:** The code might look intimidating, but you can easily find any text. Press `Ctrl + F` (on Windows) or `Cmd + F` (on Mac) to open a search box. Type a few words of the sentence you want to edit.
    * *Example:* To change the "About CAUS" text, you could search for "redefine urban living".
4.  **Make your changes:** Carefully edit the text. Be sure not to accidentally delete any of the surrounding characters like `<p>` or `>` or `"`. Just change the words inside.
5.  **Save your changes:** Scroll to the bottom of the page. You'll see a section called **"Commit changes"**.
    * In the first text box, briefly describe your change (e.g., "Updated About Us description").
    * Click the green **"Commit changes"** button.

That's it! Your changes will be live on the website within a minute or two.

### How to Update a Team Member or Add a New One

The process is very similar.

1.  Open the `index.html` file in the editor (steps 1 & 2 above).
2.  Search (`Ctrl+F` / `Cmd+F`) for the name of the person you want to edit.
3.  Change their name or title.
4.  To add a **new person**, carefully copy the entire block of code for an existing person and paste it right below. Then, change the details. A block looks like this:

    ```html
    <!-- Start of a person's block -->
    <div class="text-center">
        <img src="[https://placehold.co/400x400/a0aec0/ffffff?text=Prof.+F](https://placehold.co/400x400/a0aec0/ffffff?text=Prof.+F)" class="w-32 h-32 mx-auto rounded-full mb-4 shadow-md" alt="Researcher Photo">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-lg">Professor F</h4>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600" data-lang-key="people_role_6">New Role</p>
    </div>
    <!-- End of a person's block -->
    ```

    * Change the image URL in `src="..."` to a link for the new person's photo.
    * Change the name and title.

### How to Update the English and Korean Text

Our website supports two languages. All the text is stored at the very bottom of the `index.html` file, inside the `<script>` section.

1.  Open the editor and scroll all the way to the bottom.
2.  You will find a `translations` object. It has an `en: { ... }` block for English and a `ko: { ... }` block for Korean.
3.  Find the key for the text you want to change (e.g., `about_title: "About CAUS"`) and edit the text within the quotes. Make sure to update it in both the `en` and `ko` sections!
